# Flask Hello World App

This is a simple Python Flask web application that displays various greetings and the server's IP address.

## Features
- Route `/` returns "Hello World" and the server's IP address
- Route `/greet/<name>` returns a personalized greeting with the server's IP address
- Runs on host `0.0.0.0` and port `5000` with debug mode enabled
- Docker support for containerized deployment
- Automated testing and CI/CD pipeline

## Setup & Run

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. **Install Flask:**
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```
3. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. **Access the app:**
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or your server's IP address on port 5000.

## File Structure
- `app.py`: Main Flask application
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
- `Dockerfile`: Container configuration
- `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD pipeline configurations

## Docker Support

Build and run the application using Docker:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t flask-app:latest .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name flask-app flask-app:latest

# Test the endpoints
curl http://localhost:5000/
curl http://localhost:5000/greet/YourName
